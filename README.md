# Rectangle Using Pointers in C++

This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using a `Rectangle` class. The program shows how to access class members using **pointers to objects** and calculates the **area** and **perimeter** of a rectangle.

## 📌 Program Highlights
- Demonstrates class and object creation
- Uses pointer to access object members (`->` operator)
- Calculates area and perimeter of a rectangle
- Easy to understand for beginners

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Classes and Objects
- Pointers to Objects
- Member Functions
- Arrow (`->`) operator
- Basic C++ syntax

## 🧾 Code Explanation
- A `Rectangle` class is defined with:
  - Data members: `length`, `breadth`
  - Member functions: `area()` and `perimeter()`
- In `main()`:
  - An object `r1` is created
  - A pointer `ptr` is assigned th
